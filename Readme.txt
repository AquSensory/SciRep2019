R codes for gene co-expression analyses.

genome_mc.R

Use:
Determine whether GOIs [GOIs] falling within the same clade in an expression heatmap are more co-expressed than randomly selected (same no. of) genes [GOCs].
Monte-Carlo sampling 10000 dendrograms to obtain number of clades GOIs fall in [nGOIclades]; then sample another 10000 dendrograms to obtain number of clades GOCs fall in [nGOCclades], this is performed 5 times using different sets of GOCs. Contrasting is performed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test, with Dunn's test as post-hoc comparison.

Input:
1. Vst-transformed gene expressions of all protein coding genes, replicates are averaged for each treatment (i.e. cell type or developmental stage). These files are provided [AquPCgenes_CAP_ave, AquPCgenes_BLIND_ave].
2. Enter GOIs.

Output:
1. Boxplot showing nGOIclades and 5 sets of nGOCclades.
2. Kruskal-Wallis result 
3. Dunn's test results 



gene_network_mc.R

Use:
Determine whether GOIs are more co-expressed (having more interacting edges) in an interactome than a random set of (same no. of) genes. 
Monte-Carlo sampling 10000 subgraphs generated by random genes in synaptome.
Number of interacting edges is contrasted against that of the subgraph generated by GOIs at the confidence interval of 95%.

Input:
1. Synaptome graph. This is provided [synaptome.graphxml]
2. Enter GOIs.

Output:
Message indicating whether subgraph generated by GOIs are more connected, with corresponding p-value.
